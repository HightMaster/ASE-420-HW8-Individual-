Potential DPs & Refactors
- Singleton for Date & TimeHelper
- removing duplicate close/connect code in db_crud.py
- Use Facade for parse_input_string()

Things left to complete
- (X) Ver2 manual
- (X) Ver2 Design
- (X) Ver2 Tests
- (X) Ver2 Requirements
- (X) V1 & V2 Progress
    - (X) Cloc
    - (X) Canvas Page
- (X) Presentation
- Update Task method
- Bugs:
    - Output format could look a bit better
    - Time is not in consistent format when added to the Database
    - Datetime string conversion converts but sometimes doesn't
    - Refactoring Report to have functionality for dates
    - Refactoring arguments to use argparse instead
    - Make sure application doesn't close from bad command

Questions:
- Can we leave our documents in docx format
- Do we need 2 versions for the presentation?
- Is it ok if 2 of my design_patterns are Singleton for the refactoring?
- Do we need 2 versions for the code_smells, refactors, and design patterns?
- Do I need an update tasks method
- is Cloc supposed to only count the code? Using python should it include tests?
- Do I need to use argparse for the arguments
- How many regression/acceptance tests do we need?
- Do tests need to be included in the prototype zip file?
    - Followup??? Do tests need to be for both versions?
    - Does every single function need to have a test

All items needed for each specific version:

Design
- Design document
- UML

Requirements
- requirements

Manual
- Manual document

Tests
- Unit Tests for different functions
- At least one integration test
- Regression tests
- Acceptance tests

Progress files (Via cloc)
- Cloc progress files

All items needed for both
- Code smells
- Refactors
- Design patterns
- Presentation
